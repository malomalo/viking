   - `Viking.Controller`: Any `Viking.Controller` is now initialized and
     then the action is called. When routing to a new URL, if it is the
     same controller the new action is called but the controller is not
     reinitialized. When routing to another URL that is not using the

  - `Viking.Router`: Delayed the loading of the route callback until `route` is
    called. Allows Controllers and functions to be be loaded after the router.
  - `Viking.PaginatedCollection`: if `offset` is not included in a paginated
    response it's ignored. it was causing the inital request to load twice.
